IF a patient scheduled for elective NCS has chest pain or other symptoms
suggestive of undetected CAD, further diagnostic work-up e before NCS is
recommended.

IF a patient in need of acute NCS also has chest pain or other symptoms
suggestive of undetected CAD, a multidisciplinary assessment e approach
is recommended to choose the treatment with lowest total risk for the
patient.

In patients with dyspnoea andlor peripheral oedema, an ECG and an
NT-proBNP/BNP test is indicated before NCS, unless there is a certain
non-cardiac explanation. In patients with dyspnoea and/or peripheral
oedema and elevated NT-proBNP/BNP, TTE is recommended before NCS.

Recommendations for patient information

It is recommended to give patients individualized instructions for
pre-operative and post-operative changes in medication, in verbal and
written formats with clear and concise directions.

Recommendations for use of risk assessment tools

In patients who have known CVD or CV tisk factors (including age \>65
years), or symptoms or signs suggestive of CVD it is recommended to
obtain a pre-operative 12-lead ECG before intermediate- and high-risk
NCS.

In patients who have known CVD, CV risk factors (including age =65
years), or symptoms suggestive of CVD it is recommended to measure
hs-cTn T or hs-cTn \| before intermediate-and high-risk NCS, and at 24 h
and 48 h afterwards.

TTE is recommended in patients with poor functional capacity and/or high
NT-proBNP/BNP, or if murmurs are detected before high-risk NCS, in order
to undertake risk-reduction strategies.

Stress imaging is recommended before high-risk elective NCS in patients
with poor functional capacity and high likelihood of CAD or high dinical
risk.

It is recommended to use the same indications for ICA and
revascularization pre-operatively as in the non-surgical setting.

In low-risk patients undergoing low- and intermediate-risk NCS, it is
not recommended to routinely obtain pre-operative ECG, hs-cTn Til, or
BNP/NT-proBNP concentrations. Routine pre-operative evaluation of LV
function is not recommended.

Stress imaging is not recommended routinely before NCS.

Routine pre-operative ICA is not recommended in stable CCS patients
undergoing low- and intermediate-risk NCS.

Recommendations for CV risk factors and lifestyle interventions ‘Smoking
cessation \>4 weeks before NCS is recommended to reduce post-operative
complications and mortality.

Control of CV risk factors—including blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, and
diabetes—is recommended before NCS.

Recommendations for pharmacological risk-reduction strategies
Beta-blockers Peri-operative continuation of beta-blockers is
recommended in patients currently receiving this medication.

Routine initiation of beta-blocker peri-operatively is not recommended.

Statins In patients already on statins, it is recommended to continue
statins during the peri-operative period.

Recommendations for peri-operative handling of antithrombotic agents
Antiplatelets It is recommended to delay elective NCS until 6 months
after elective PCI and 12 months after an ACS.

In patients with a recent PCI scheduled for NCS, it is recommended that
management of antiplatelet therapy is discussed between the ia G

In patients with a previous PCI, it is recommended to continue aspirin
peri-operatively if the bleeding risk allows. ee

Ifinterruption of P2Y 12 inhibitor is indicated, itis recommended to
withhold ticagrelor for 3-5 days, clopidogrel for 5 days, and prasugrel

for 7 days prior to NCS.

For patients undergoing high bleeding risk surgery (e.g. intracranial,
spinal neurosurgery, or vitroretinal eye surgery), itis recommended c

to interrupt aspirin for at least 7 days pre-operatively.

Ifantiplatelet therapy has been interrupted before a surgical procedure,
itis recommended to restart therapy as soon as possible (within 48 h)
post-surgery, according to interdisciplinary risk assessment.

Oral anticoagulants

When an urgent surgical intervention is required, it is recommended that
NOAC therapy is immediately interrupted. \| \| G

S

In minor bleeding risk surgery and other procedures where bleeding can
easily be controlled, it is recommended to perform surgery without
interruption of OAC therapy.

In non-minor bleeding risk procedures in patients using a NOAC, it is
recommended to use an interruption regimen based on the NOAC compound,
renal function, and bleeding risk.

In patients using NOACs, it is recommended that minor bleeding risk
procedures are performed at trough levels (typically 12-24 h after e
last intake). LMWH is recommended, as an alternative to UFH, for
bridging in patients with MHVs and high surgical risk.

Bridging of OAC therapy is not recommended in patients with low/moderate
thrombotic risk undergoing NCS.

Use of reduced-dose NOAC to attenuate the risk of post-operative
bleeding is not recommended.

Recommendations for peri-operative thromboprophylaxis

It is recommended that decisions about peri-operative thromboprophylaxis
in NCS are based on individual and procedure-specific risk \| \| A
factors.

If thromboprophylaxis is deemed necessary, it is recommended to choose
the type and duration of thromboprophylaxis (LMWH, NOAC, or
fondaparinux) according to type of NCS, duration of immobilization, and
patient-related factors.

Recommendations for patient blood management in NCS Itis recommended to
measure haemoglobin pre-operatively in patients scheduled for
intermediate- to high-risk NCS.

It is recommended to treat anaemia in advance of NCS in order to reduce
the need for RBC transfusion during NCS. In patients undergoing surgery
with expected blood loss of \>500 ml, use of washed cell salvage is
recommended.

It is recommended to use point-of-care diagnostics for guidance of blood
component therapy, when available.

Recommendations for management of patients with specific diseases
undergoing NCS A) Patients with CAD If PCI is indicated before NCS, the
use of new-generation DES is recommended over BMS and balloon
angioplasty.

If NCS can safely be postponed (e.g. at least 3 months), it is
recommended that patients with ACS being scheduled for NCS undergo
diagnostic and therapeutic interventions as recommended for ACS patients
in general. Routine myocardial revascularization before low-and
intermediate-risk NCS in patients with CCS is not recommended.

B\) Patients with heart failure

In patients with suspected or known HF scheduled for high-risk NCS, it
is recommended to evaluate LV function with echocardiography and
measurement of NT-proBNP/BNP levels, unless this has recently been
performed.

Itis recommended that patients with HF undergoing NCS receive optimal
medical treatment according to current ESC Guidelines. (By

In patients with HF undergoing NCS, it is recommended to regularly
assess volume status and signs of organ perfusion. im G

A multidisciplinary team including VAD specialists is recommended for
peri-operative management of patients with HF receiving e mechanical
circulatory support.

C\) Patients with VHD.

Clinical and echocardiographic evaluation (if not recently performed) is
recommended in all patients with known or suspected VHD \| \| G who are
scheduled for elective intermediate- or high-risk NCS. AVR (SAVRor TAVI)
is recommended in symptomatic patients with severe AS who are scheduled

symptomatic severe AR or asymptomatic severe AR and LVESD \>50 mm or
LVESDi (LVESD/BSA) \>25 mmim? (in e patients with small body size) or
resting LVEF \<50%, valve surgery is recommended prior to elective
intermediate- or high-risk NCS. In patients with moderate-to-severe
rheumatic MS and symptoms or SPAP \>50 mmHg, valve intervention
(percutaneous mitral e commissurotomy or surgery) is recommended before
elective intermediate- or high-risk NCS. D) Patients with ACHD In
patients with ACHD, a consultation with an ACHD specialist is
recommended before intermediate- or high-risk surgery. G In patients
with ACHD, itis recommended that intermediate- and high-risk elective
surgery is performed in a centre with experience in ma e the care of
ACHD patients. E) Patients with arrhythmias

c

In patients with SVT controlled by medication, it is recommended that
AADs are continued during the peri-operative period. ma In AF patients
with acute or worsening haemodynamic instability undergoing NCS,
emergency electrical cardioversion is recommended. mm a

In patients with symptomatic, monomorphic, and sustained VT associated
with myocardial scar, recurring despite optimal medical

therapy, ablation of arrhythmia is recommended before elective NCS. cee
lt is recommended that patients with temporarily deactivated ICDs have
continuous ECG monitoring, and during the peri-operative period are
accompanied by personnel skilled in early detection and treatment of
arrhythmias. In high-risk patients (e.g. pacemaker-dependant or ICD
patients), or if access to the torso will be difficult during the
procedure, it is recommended to place transcutaneous
pacing/defibrillation pads prior to NCS.

It is recommended that all patients with CIEDs that are reprogrammed
before surgery have a re-check and necessary reprogramming as \| \| e

lt is recommended to continue chronic therapy for PAH in the
peri-operative phase of NCS. \| G It is recommended that haemodynamic
monitoring of patients with severe PAH continues for at least 24 h in
the post-operative period. \| e In the case of progression of right HF
in the post-operative period in patients with PAH, it is recommended
that the diuretic dose be

optimized and, if necessary, iv. prostacyclin analogues be initiated
under the guidance of a physician experienced in the management of c

PAH. G) Patients with hypertension In patients with chronic hypertension

Recommendations for peri-operative monitoring and anaesthesia In order
to preserve optimal CV stability, it is recommended to apply
goal-directed haemodynamic therapy in patients undergoing (1

Itis recommended to avoid post-operative acute pain. aS

In order to minimize the risk of post-operative organ dysfunction, it is
recommended to avoid an intra-operative mean arterial pressure decrease
of \>20% from baseline values or \<60-70 mmHg for \>10 min.

Non-aspirin NSAIDs are not recommended as first-line analgesics in
patients with established or high risk of CVD. eee

Recommendations for treatment of post-operative cardiovascular
complications

It is recommended to have high awareness of peri-operative CV
complications, combined with surveillance for PMI in patients undergoing
intermediate- or high-risk NCS.

‘Systematic PMI work-up is recommended to identify the underlying
pathophysiology and define therapy.

Itis recommended to treat post-operative STEMI, NSTE-ACS, acute HF, and
tachyarrhythmias in accordance with guidelines for the non-surgical
setting, after interdisciplinary discussion with the surgeon about
bleeding risk.

In patients with post-operative PE of high or intermediate clinical
probability, initiation of anticoagulation is recommended without delay,
while diagnostic work-up is in progress, if bleeding risk is low.

Post-operative oral anticoagulation for PE is recommended to be
administered for a period of at least 3 months.
